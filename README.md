# My Personal Portfolio Website à²¥_à²¥

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

``My name is Thabo Russel Mphela, and I'm a first-year student on a journey to become a developer. I'm passionate about building things, solving problems, and, of course, music. You could say I'm known as "The Headphones Guy."``

This is my personal portfolio website, a simple, clean, and responsive site that marks my first online presence in the tech world. As a first-year student of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, this project showcases my journey and commitment to the field.
